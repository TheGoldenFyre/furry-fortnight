   <h2>Why choose vscode?</h2> 
    <section>
        <h3>Out of the many other text and code editors out here, why would you choose vscode as your primary editor?</h3>    
        <h4>It's open source</h4>
        No mystery. Fully customizable. Visual Studio Code is fully open source and backed by a large community of passionate developers who are ready to make a good experience even better. And it runs everywhere! Wether it be macOS, Linux or Windows, you'll never feel limited. 
        <h4>Error-proof</h4>
        Using IntelliSense, coding has never been easier. Get notified of errors in your code before runtime, and boost your productivity by using smart recommendations to extend your codebase.
        <h4>Make it yours</h4>
        Customizing your instance of vscode has never been easier. Themes can be downloaded from the store in order to personalize the aesthetics of your vscode, and download extensions to add syntax highlighting for new languages, add new feature's to existing ones and much more. 
        <h4>Built in source control</h4>
        Source control is built right into the application, so you don't ever have to worry about difficult git command line arguments. Just clone a github repository, and you're ready to get to coding. 
        No wasted time. No lost code ever again.
