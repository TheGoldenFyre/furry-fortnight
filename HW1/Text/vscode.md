# Visual Studio Code
VSCode, for all your code editing needs

## Why choose VSCode?
Out of the many other text and code editors out here, why would you choose VSCode as your primary editor?
### Fully open source
No mystery. Fully customizable. Visual Studio Code is fully open source and backed by a large community of passionate developers who are ready to make a good experience even better. Wether it be macOS, Linux or Windows, this cross-platform editor will never make you feel boxed in.
### Lightweight but feature-rich
Using IntelliSense, coding has never been easier. Boost your productivity by getting AI based code recommendations while you're still typing, just like in a fully fledged IDE. Error handling isn't a problem either, because the built in Problems window gives you an overview of all faults that might be in your code, and ways that you might fix them.
### Make it yours
Customizing your instance of VSCode has never been easier. Themes can be downloaded from the Marketplace in order to personalize the aesthetics of your VSCode, and download extensions to add syntax highlighting for new languages, add new feature's to existing ones and much more. 
### Built in source control
Source control is built right into the application, so you don't have to worry about external programs or half-working plugins. Simply clone a repository, and you're ready to get to coding. 
No time wasted on command line arguments. No lost code ever again.
### Adapts to your experience
Coming from another text editor? Transfer that muscle memory! Multiple extensions can be installed to make VSCode's shortcuts and interactions feel more like the ones that you're already used to, without losing the unique extra functionalities. Extensions for most other popular code editors come preconfigured, so no need to rely on community projects.
