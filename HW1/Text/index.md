# Death to PHP
## Or do we actually want that?

### The good
- Easy to find a job
- Kieken 


### The bad
- Hella security issues
- Easy to learn but hard to master
- Does not fit with the current web landscape
- Not strongly typed (not that js is, but we have typescript for that)
- Allows for much freedom.... which causes errors
- Middle of the road for fastness
- Causes you to need to invest more in other areas bc it's hard to contribute to other things than web with php.

### The ugly
