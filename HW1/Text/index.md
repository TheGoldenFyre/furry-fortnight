Bart van Dooren | Even though Notepad++ was forced upon me while I was learning to code, I have learned to appreciate it a lot. Its simple interface makes sense, and it doesn't annoy you with features that you won't use. It might be a little barebones out of the box, but the supported plugins easily make up for that.
Tomec | VSCode's built in debugging features have saved me from just using console.log() statements, and the themes makes it look really pretty. Other than that, I'd say the default shortcuts are easy to learn and can be easily transfered to an IDE like Visual Studio.
VimConnoisseur87 | Everyone who doesn't use Vim is doing something wrong in their life; imagine not using the advanced features and shortcuts that Vim offers. Having a graphical user interface? Not necessary whatsoever. It's just a distraction. If you're not typing at least 150 words per minute in your editor switching between input and editing more every 5 seconds, don't even try to become a programmer.
