Vim, the ubiquitous text editor
## Why use Vim?
Out of all of the other text editors, why would you use Vim? (other than it just being a flex on your colleagues)
### All-powerful
If you want to do something, you can do it. Vim should be seen as a tool, and once you've learned how to use it, it's one of the most powerful text-editing tools on the market. 
Advanced macro's and a fully fledged editing history give you the control you need. The use of chainable motions and operators allows you to combine powerfull commands without as much as a thought.
### Extensibility
Customisation stops at nothing. Vim features a built in scripting language that can be used to extend the functionality of the editor. Don't feel like making your own scripts? No worries, someone has probably done it for you. Just download one of the thousands of already available plugins to make your coding experience even better.
### Syntax highlighting
If the language exists, there'll be Vim syntax highlighting for it. Make code easier to read in over 200 built-in languages, with new ones being added regularly.
And if you don't like the default colors, just change them to your liking! Everything's customizable in the config files.
### User friendly
Even though it might not look like it at first sight, Vim is very beginner friendly. Althouhg it has quite a steep learning curve, shortcuts are often logical and easily remembered, making the extra functionality with exclusively keyboard inputs worth the initial time investment. There's even a built in tutorial to teach new users the basics in about half an hour!
### Completely text based
The Vim editor is completely text based without a graphical user interface, which makes it excellent for use in low-end devices that have limited system resources. This also means that Vim can easily be used over remote desktop connections such as SSH or VNC!
