    <h2>Why choose Notepad++?</h2> 
     <section>
         <h3>Out of the many other text and code editors out here, why would you choose Notepad++ as your primary editor?</h3>    
         <h4>Familiar, but advanced</h4>
         By keeping the classics in mind, but not being afraid to improve on them, Notepad++ provides a familiar user interface which has been extended to provide more functionality. Hop right in and use the code editor as you would any other graphical based text editor, but don't shy away from looking around a bit and discovering the more advanced features.
         <h4>Keep it fresh</h4>
         Tired of the boring white text editor? Change it! Notepad++ makes it easy to fully customize its user interface to your liking. Window colors, accents, and even syntax highlighting for over 50 built in languages can all be changed to make the editor more yours.
         <h4>Plug? In!</h4>
         A wide selection of user created plugins can help you be even more productive when using Notepad++. Everything from more powerful indentation management tools to difference comparisons, if you need it it's pretty likely someone'll have made a plugin for it. A complete list of all user maintained plugins can even be found <a href="https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList/blob/master/doc/plugin_list_x64.md"> here!</a>
         <h4>Small but efficient</h4>
         Did you know that a Notepad++ installation only 4 MB's of space? That's tiny - only the size of about 3 full hd .png images. And that small program size makes it hyper-efficient too; Notepad++ prides itself in being an eco-friendly text editor, because it has very low cpu usage and thus wastes less energy!
