        <h2>Why choose Notepad++?</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Out of the many other text and code editors out here, why would you choose Notepad++ as your primary
                editor?</h3>
            <h4>Familiar, but advanced</h4>
            <img class="review_img" src="images/notepad.png" alt="notepad++ logo">
            <p>By keeping the classics in mind, but not being afraid to improve on them, Notepad++ provides a familiar
                user interface which has been extended to provide more functionality. Hop right in and use the code
                editor as you would any other graphical based text editor, but don't shy away from looking around a bit
                and discovering the more advanced features.</p>
            <h4>Keep it fresh</h4>
            <p>Tired of the boring white text editor? Change it! Notepad++ makes it easy to fully customize its user
                interface to your liking. Window colors, accents, and even syntax highlighting for over 50 built in
                languages can all be changed to make the editor more yours.</p>
            <h4>Plug? In!</h4>
            <p>A wide selection of user created plugins can help you be even more productive when using Notepad++.
                Everything from more powerful indentation management tools to difference comparisons, if you need it
                it's pretty likely someone'll have made a plugin for it. A complete list of all user maintained plugins
                can even be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList/blob/master/doc/plugin_list_x64.md">
                    here!</a></p>
            <h4>Small but efficient</h4>
            <p>Did you know that a Notepad++ installation only 4 MB's of space? That's tiny - only the size of about 3
                full hd .png images. And that small program size makes it hyper-efficient too; Notepad++ prides itself
                in being an eco-friendly text editor, because it has very low cpu usage and thus wastes less energy!</p>
