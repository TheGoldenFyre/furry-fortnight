    <h2>Why use Vim?</h2> 
     <section>
         <h3>Out of all the other valid for text editors, why would you use Vim?</h3>    
         <h4>All-powerful</h4>
         If you want to do something, you can do it. Vim should be seen as a tool, and once you've learned how to use it, it's one of the most powerful text-editing tools on the market. 
         Advanced macro's and a fully fledged editing history give you the control you need. The use of chainable motions and operators allows you to combine powerfull commands without as much as a thought.
         <h4>Extensibility</h4>
         Customisation stops at nothing. Vim features a built in scripting language that can be used to extend the functionality of the editor. Don't feel like making your own scripts? No worries, someone has probably done it for you. Just download one of the thousands of already available plugins to make your coding experience even better.
         <h4>Syntax highlighting</h4>
         If the language exists, there'll be Vim syntax highlighting for it. Make code easier to read in over 200 built-in languages, with new ones being added regularly.
         And if you don't like the default colors, just change them to your liking! Everything's customizable in the config files.
         <h4>User friendly</h4>
         Even though it might not look like it at first sight, Vim is very beginner friendly. Learn the basic switching of text input and command mode, and then you're off to the races at incredible speed!
